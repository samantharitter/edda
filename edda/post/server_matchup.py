def address_matchup(db, coll_name):
    """Runs an algorithm to match servers with their
    corresponding hostnames/IP addresses.  The algorithm works as follows,
    using replica set status messages from the logs to find addresses:

    - Make a list, mentioned_names of all the IPs being talked about;
    these must be all the servers in the network.
    - For each server (S) in the collName.servers collection, if it
    already has been matched to an IP address and hostname, remove
    these addresses from mentioned_names.  Move to next server.
    - Else, make a list of the addresses (S) mentions, neighbors_of_s
    - If (S) has a known IP address or hostname:
        (stronger algorithm)
        - find all neighbors of (S) and the addresses
        they mention (their neighbors)
        - Make a list of addresses that ALL neighbors of (S)
        mention, neighbor_neighbors
        - By process of elimination between neighbors_of_s and
        neighbors_neighbors, see if there remains one address
        in neighbors_neighbors that (S) has not
        mentioned in its log entries.  This must be (S)'s address.
        Remove this address from mentioned_names.
    - Else (weaker algorithm):
        - By process of elimination between neighbors_of_s and
        mentioned_names, see if there remains one address in
        mentioned_names that (S) has not mentioned in its log entries.
        This must be (S)'s address.  Remove this address from
        mentioned_names.
    - Repeat this process until mentioned_names is empty trying
    each server round-robin, or until all servers have been unsuccessfully
    tried since the last change was made to mentioned_names.

    This algorithm is only sound when the user provides a
    log file from every server in the network, and complete when
    the network graph was complete, or was a tree (connected and acyclic)
